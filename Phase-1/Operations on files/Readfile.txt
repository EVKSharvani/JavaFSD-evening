Read a text file using FileReader in Java:

To read the contents of a text file, the idea is to create a new FileReader 
and read the whole file character by character using Readerâ€™s read() method,
 as shown below. It returns the character read, or -1 if the end of the 
 stream is reached, and throws an IOException if an I/O error occurs.
